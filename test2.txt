Angkor Wat, located in Cambodia, is one of the most
 iconic and significant archaeological sites in the 
 world. Originally constructed in the early 12th 
 century by King Suryavarman II, it was initially dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu before transitioning into a Buddhist temple in the later centuries. The temple complex is renowned for its grandeur, intricate carvings, and architectural brilliance, symbolizing the pinnacle of the Khmer Empire's achievements.

Spanning over 400 acres, Angkor Wat is the largest 
religious monument globally. Its design reflects a 
microcosm of the Hindu universe, with the central 
towers representing Mount Meru, the mythical home 
of the gods. The temple's walls are adorned with 
exquisite bas-reliefs depicting Hindu epics like the 
Ramayana and Mahabharata, as well as scenes from Khmer 
history.

Angkor Wat is not only a UNESCO World Heritage Site but
 also a source of immense pride for Cambodians, appearing 
 on the national flag. It attracts millions of visitors 
 annually, drawn by its historical significance and spiritual
  aura. Despite centuries of wear, Angkor Wat remains 
  a testament to human ingenuity and devotion, standing 
  as a timeless symbol of Cambodia's cultural and historical 
  heritage.
